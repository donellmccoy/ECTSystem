/// This entity maps permissions to user groups, defining which groups have which permissions.
/// Users inherit all permissions from the groups they belong to (via CoreUserRole).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Permission inheritance chain:
/// 1. User is assigned to one or more groups (CoreUserRole)
/// 2. Each group has multiple permissions (CoreGroupPermission)
/// 3. User inherits all permissions from all their groups
/// 4. Exclude permissions (Exclude=true) override grant permissions
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Example:
/// - User John is in groups: "Case Workers" and "Supervisors"
/// - Case Workers group has permissions: Form.348.View, Form.348.Edit
/// - Supervisors group has permissions: Workflow.Approve, Data.ViewUnit
/// - John has all four permissions: Form.348.View, Form.348.Edit, Workflow.Approve, Data.ViewUnit
